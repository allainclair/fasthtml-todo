# [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml) framework

## Motivation

- I first found [HTMX](https://htmx.org) and I saw we can build "React Like" (e.g. SPA but with SSR) apps without JavaScript.
- HTMX is simple to understand and use.
- It made me a lot more interested in Frontend apps because we can our apps in the browser.
- With a decent frontend (basics) knowledge we can build entire web apps.
- We can use HTMX + Jinja templates with Python, but...
- I found [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml), and it simplifies HTMX+Python+Jinja. 

## Tech Stack
